Tests:
    Unit Tests
    Functional Tests for each option

Architecture:
    Make comic archive module more like the other format modules?
    Map module deps and reorg better
    Make a settings concept for libpicopt

Packaging:
    PIL/Pillow is still a mess.
    DPKG uses python-imaging I think RPM is the same. I think python Pillow/PIL dependency isn't satisfied by either.
Formats:
    PDF would be cool, but difficult due to non-standard image formats and lack of easy PDF exploders/bundlers.
