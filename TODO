Packaging:
    PIL/Pillow is still a mess.
    DPKG doesn't see python-imaging quite right, I think RPM is the same

Tests:
    More formal tests.
    Test each option.

Formats:
    Compressing images inside PDFs would be cool, but difficult due to non-standard image formats and lack of easy PDF exploders/bundlers.
