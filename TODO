Packaging:
    PIL/Pillow is still a mess.
    DPKG uses python-imaging I think RPM is the same. I think python Pillow/PIL dependency isn't satisfied by either.

Tests:
    More formal tests.
    Test each option.
    Unit Tests?

Formats:
    PDF would be cool, but difficult due to non-standard image formats and lack of easy PDF exploders/bundlers.

Architecture:
    Break up into smaller modules
